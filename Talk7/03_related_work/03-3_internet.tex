\subsection{Internet Infrastructure (DNS / BGP)}
\label{subsec:03_dns}

\textbf{Length: around 2 pages}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Provide a short overview of the internet infrastructure with DNS/BGP, corresponding threats, and security mechanisms
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Decentralized DNS}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Describe how blockchain-based DNS systems implement and enhance traditional DNS protocols
  \item Describe how domain management could work in such a distributed setting (i.e., if there are no central parties)
  \item Discuss security benefits of decentralizing DNS with blockchain when compared to traditional approaches
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{BGP}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Short excursion on how BGP could be implemented on a blockchain basis
  \item Discuss the benefits and big challenges of applying the blockchain to low-level internet infrastructure like BGP (scalability, performance, etc.)
\end{itemize}
