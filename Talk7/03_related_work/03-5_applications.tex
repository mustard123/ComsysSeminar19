\subsection{Specific Applications}

% TODO: improve section title
In this section we take a closer look at applications that are linked to cybersecurity on a secondary level: Here the BC is not per se used to mitigate direct cybersecurity threats, but is used to make applications more robust, error-prone and less vulnerable. So the BC does solve cybersecurity related issues, but in a more indirect way.
\begin{itemize}
\item Length: 3-4 pages
\item Applications that are related on a second level
\item Not a direct implication for CS measures
\item Instead, BC helps to secure the security of a system
Different classes of applications:
\item Applications related to the fields of evaluated according to the following criteria:
\subitem Quality of the System: Advantages and Disadvantages
\subitem Is there an absolute need for BC or could this problem be solved without?
\subitem Relation to Cybersecurity and Security of related systems
\item The following sections are to be explored further
\subitem E-Voting \cite{Osgood2016} \cite{BenAyed2017a}
\subitem Automonous Vehicles \cite{Dorri2017} \cite{Rowan2017a}
\subitem Personal Data Protection \cite{Zyskind2015a}
\subitem Personal Data Sharing and Patient Monitoring \cite{Yue2016a}
\subitem Smart Cities and IoT \cite{Biswas2016a}
\subitem Communication \cite{Rowan2017a}
\subitem Power Transaction
\subitem Data Exchange
