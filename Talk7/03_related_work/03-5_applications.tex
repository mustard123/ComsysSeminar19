\subsection{Specific Applications}
\label{subsec:03_applications}

In this section we take a closer look at applications that are linked to cybersecurity on a secondary level: Here the Blockchain is not per se used to mitigate direct cybersecurity threats, but is used to make applications more robust, error-prone and less vulnerable. So the Blockchain does solve cybersecurity related issues, but in a more indirect way.

\subsubsection{Assessment Criteria}
Below we want to introduce different scenarios of applications (existing or proof-of-work drafts) for the Blockchain technology and apart from a brief introduction of the challenges and problems of this specific field, answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the quality of this specific type of application regarding cybersecurity? 
	\item How do they make use of the Blockchain Technology?
	\item Is the BC really needed or could the problems be solved without it? 
\end{enumerate}
To answer question number 3 we are going to make use of the below schema presented by \citeauthor{Wust2017} in \cite{Wust2017}, that helps spliting real use cases from unnecessary ones.

\subsubsection{E-Voting}
Problem statement: Foundation of every successful democracy, must be accessible for all eligible citicens. Most common systems today are paper-based voting systems, have two major drawbacks. 1. Not scalable, 2. reliant on the procedural security of officials conducting their jobs. Various combinations exist, multiple security vulnerabilities pop up, that lead to an enourmous risk of election rigging and fraud. The Blockchain as system that is verifiable, scalable and tamper-proof, seems to be a good idea as solution. 

Idea for solution: Use the Blockchain technology for a transparent and incorruptible database that cannot have a single point of failure or be controlled by a single entity. Answers question 1

Several systems exist up till today. Not all rely on the same amount of integration of the Blockchain itself. Different use cases either in theory or in practice have already been tested on smaller county elections or within private organizations \cite{BenAyed2017}.

Estonian I-Voting System: Estonia was the first country where citizens where able to cast their vote online and with an electronic national identification card based on the Blockchain technology
Norwegian I-Voting System: In 2011 Norway used and eletronic remote voting system  for country council elections. The project was 2014 discontinued due to the fear of votes going public in case of a cyber attack.
New South Wales iVote System: In 2015 New South Wales used a hybrid blockchain based voting system.

General problems with the different systems: Single point of failure and closeness of critical parts of the code


Votebook (Quelle): Case study on Blockchain voting. No remote voting due to too many threats. Biggest problems: Authenticating user, voters computer as single point of failure DoS Attack.
Ressembles todays systems, based on paper voting and voting stations that have the Blockchain as backend.
System based on a permissioned, private blockchain with the voting stations as nodes
Follow my Vote (Quelle): Fundamentally different than Votebook. Each voter installs a local "Voting Box" on his computer, authenticating via uploaded official documents through the organization that holds the election. Each voter requests ballot online and votes. Allow for early voting as well as altering the vote later on. Based on  \citeauthor{Osgood2016} optimistic but flawed approach: Authentication and scaring off remote voters is a problem.

Vote Watchers (Quelle): Ressembles Votebook regarding the existence of paper ballots and real world voting stations. Each ballot contains three QR codes - 1 for BC address, 1 for ballot ID, 1 for election ID. Once ballot is scanned, the appropriate vote is sent to proper candidates unique address (like wallet) on an local offline BC of the voting station. After election is complete all data from local blockchain is put on a DVD and the machine is synchronized with the other machines for an evaluation of the voting results. 
Advantage: Offline use, allows no interference from hackers, at the same time the votes for each candidate can be checked in "real time" (??) by a blockchain explorer.
Uses BC only for tamper-proofness and public auditing, with everything else backed on paper ballots.

Proposition of \citeauthor{Osgood2016} is therefore a system that still relies upon paper ballots, where people have to authenticate by showing up in real life at a real world voting booth, that uses the Blockchain for its tamper-proofness and ability to account as an auditing system

Proposition of \citeauthor{BenAyed2017}:
Tries to fulfill the following criteria: 1 (Authentication)Only people already registered to vote can cast votes. The system does not include registration and authentification has to be done externally. 2 (Anonymity) The system will not allow any links between voters votes and identities. 3 (Accuracy) Votes must be accurate and votes can neither be changed, nor duplicated, nor removed. 4 (Verifiablity): The system is verifiable to make sure all votes are counted correctly
Limitations: User as single point of failure is still a problem and inability to change the vote once casted.

General problem: Spotlight too much on the developed part of the world instead of focussing regions where a trust-less system is really used.

Question 3: 
In a voting scenario the authorities need the state of an election to be stored at all times during an election. For one, because of verifiability of the results in the end, but also because of any security related problems that could cause a shutdown of one or multiple of the voting stations. The writers are the voters and need to be known or in any way authenticated by a third party. In this scenario only an organization that has access to all the data is able to do that. In most cases this leaves only the government as a real option. In this scenario the voters per definition do not trust other voters as everyone is assumed to have a different desired output. 
According to the diagram by  \citeauthor{Wust2017} the use of Blockchain technology therefore only makes sense in country where the government is not a thrusted third party. In which case a public permissioned Blockchain would be the best solution.
Nevertheless, it is the role of the government that causes the dilemma itself. If the non-existing trust in the government is the justification for the use of the Blockchain, the question arises whether the government can be trusted regarding the authentication of the voters. Even though a systematic rigging is harder to achieve with this approach, the problem remains at hand. 

While the Blockchain does seem to be perfect for a voting situations, its justification remains questionable. Especially, because it still leaves the most important point of failure unprotected: The user himself. Even the most tamperproofed, blockchain-based voting system does not prevent hackers from a man-in-the-middle attack from a compromised end-device. 

To sum this chapter up: Many of the desired e-Voting properties that the Blockchain technology provides have trade-offs. The aspect of privacy is just one of many. On the other hand, no system has yet been proposed that has been shown to be secure, verifiable and private at the same time. The question of authentifiation comes into play as additional point of failure of the concept.
Therefore: If a online trusted third party exists, the use of the blockchain is not necessary. If the government is trusted as far as the authentification of the voters goes, a public permissioned Blockchain can be a good fit. However the security of the system then relies on the interity of the validators. 
If the government is trusted not at all, there exists no solution that overcomes that systematic flaw in a countries governance.

The Blockchain can therefore be a solution if the question of authentification can be answered satisfactorily. Otherwise a traditional paper based voting system is as good as voting system including Blockchain based systems or systems that base on a trusted third party.

\subsubsection{Autonomous Vehicles, Smart Cities \& IoT}
Smart vehicles are increasingly connected to infrastructure such as traffic management systems, other vehicles and also more generally the Internet, thus making the vehicles part of the Internet of Things (IoT). This developement brings obvious advantages, but also many challenges, especially in the area of cybersecurity. Malicious attacks on a vehicle endanger not only the vehicles data and the passengers of the vehicle itself, but also other road users. And while many conventional security and privacy methods exist to reduce the risk of an attack they tend to be ineffective due to centralization, unscalability and unsecure communication architectures \cite{DorriSteger2017}.
Meanwhile the challenges on a secure and yet scalable system for connecting self-driving vehicles with not only each other, but also with other participating entities such as power stations and traffic management systems are many: They need to be scalable, secure and tamper-proof, private but at the same time accessible to specific other entities

The Blockchain offers solutions by design to before mentioned problems: It works decentralized and is tamperproof at all times. The idea of connecting autonomous vehicles to a system based on the Blockchain technology immediately comes to mind.
At the same time its design does not include the aspect of privacy per se. The mentioned challenges are tackled in various approaches. Therefore various approaches exist to connect self-driving vehicles with a blockchain-based architecture.

Idea of \citeauthor{DorriSteger2017}: A decentralized privacy-preserving and secure blockchain-based architecture for the smart vehicle ecosystem. It bases on its own Blockchain called Lightweight Scalable Blockchain (LSB) that minimizes the overhead and increases scalablility as well as the throughput.
It consists of clusters of nodes which are connected to the system via their Cluster Heads (CHs) also called Overlay Block Managers (OBMs).  All Transactions are broadcast to and verified by the OBMs. 
To ensure the users privacy, each vehicle is equipped with an internal vehicle storage to store sensitive data. It is the vehicle owner himself, who defines which data is provided to third parties and which data is not.
The complete system looks the following way: Each vehicle is part of the Internet of Things and hence connected to the Internet. Through this link the vehicle is connected to an overlay consisting of various OBMs that form the nodes of the Blockchain based system.
The vehicle generates single signature transactions in pre-defined time intervalls containing the signed hash of the data stored in the in-vehicle storage. This transaction is sent to and validated by the closest OBM, which finally stores it in the Blockchain That way at all times, the users datas integriy can be validated.
To make certain Public Keys identifiable in the real world a trusted third party is involved and the mechanism is centralized. This is needed in the case of service centers and software providers.
Through this ecosystem various standard applications can be leveraged, such as remote software updates, vehicle insurance, Smart Charging and Vehicle Sharing Devices.

Idea of \citeauthor{Rowan2017}: Their paper focusses on the communication between two vehicles and vehicles and infrastructures through side-channels such as visible light and acoustic signals. To solve the problem of the limited data throughput while trying to securely validate the other communication partner, centralized approaches were discarded due to the high number of manufacturers and standards. Instead \citeauthor{Rowan2017} propose a blockchain based domain name system an dpublic key infrastructure, as they do not require centralisation in order to push data into the distributed database. 
The blockchain based approach was chosen as most promising way of storing public keys due to its robustness and security regarding large scale attacks. 
In the case of \citeauthor{Rowan2017} the Blockstack (Quelle) software was used. It is an open source, per reviewed application stack implementation that provides identity, naming, storage and authentication services. It ressembles a distributed database without central management.
To establish a session between two parties, the paper now proposes a new approach, designed to integrate the security and communications requirements in authonoumous vehicle communication: Based on the TLS 1.2 handshake it differs only in one point: To minimize the throughput requirement it uses a blockchain distributed hashtable. 
All in all the systems advantages are huge:
It has a very small required throughput, it is able to locate the vehicle being communicated with, the vehicle can be authenticated using a certificate, the encryption is symmetric using PKI architecture.

The main use of the Blockchain in this case is therefore its use for the handshake itself. The communication in this scenario needs to be extremeley fast and include as little overhead as possible and work in the absence of any wireless or any cantralized infrastructure. To make this possible, the handshake, that authenticates the involved partners and establishes a secure session, makes use of the Blockchain in the form of a decentralized Domain Name Service.

In this case the Blockchain is used as a way to replace the need for a central authority when authenticating another vehicle. By creating a decentralized Name Service that binds the licence plate value and an identity together with a certificate it is able to create a good base for a secure session between two verifiably trusted vehicles.

However the paper does give little information about, where the different nodes of the blockchain lie and how they communicate. It is only assumed that the vehicles are the nodes.

Autonomous vehicles communicating with each other using the Blockchain as a base for authentication seems like a good use case. The application requires to store the state of the data, there are multiple writers, that are not trusted and online access to a central authority or a trusted third party can not be assumed at all times. Applying the flow-chart by \citeauthor{Wust2017}, this use case calls for a private permissioned Blockchain. 
According to the paper by \citeauthor{Rowan2017} this is exactly what was done. 
Nevertheless the use of any private permissioned blockchain requires central registration through a trusted third party in the first place. And it is this very point that raises the following question: One main reason for the use of the Blockchain as a decentralized public key domain name service in favor of a central authority, was the fact, that "a centralized system would not find favour due to the multitude of manufacturers, political regions and vehicle types" \cite{Rowan2017}. Why would this be different when issueing certificates?
In the end we still run into the problem that we need an external party that trustfully binds real goods to a public key in the digital world. 
To use the Blockchain to create a decentralized name service is a good and useful idea as it does not rely on the Internet, but the underlying assumption that it does get rid of any central authority is flawed.

Did i understand it right???


\citeauthor{Sharma2017} identifies several challenges when creating a network for autonomous vehicles. First, versatility of the host and the heterogeneity need to be considered for creating a robust network suited for inter-vehicular communication. Another main concern is are the privacy and security aspects: Setting up trust connections the vehicles is fundamental. The vehicular network is an arrangement of vehicles, which shares the capacity of registering force, Internet access and the capacity to frame ordinaly distributed computing.

The main security difficulties of such a vehicular network are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Verification and respectability of messages in an environment where the nodes are highly mobile
	\item Confidentiality of messages by using cryptography
	\item Guarantee safe area and restriction because vehicles are dependent of the area they are in
	\item Ensuring the security of put away information on the cloud
	\item Secure this put away information against unapproved misuses
\end{itemize}

\citeauthor{Sharma2017} propose a "Block-VN-model", an architecture based on the blockchain, which allows the developement of the distributed network of large-scale vehicles in an efficient and effective way. In this model the controller nodes are connected in a distributed manner to provide the necessary services on a large scale. The vehicle nodes fall into two categories: miner nodes, that handle request/response requests and ordinary nodes, that sends a service request message to miner nodes or to the controller nodes directly.

The system is set up in a hierarchical way. At the top there exist two trusted third parties that register the vehicles (e.g. Department of Motor Vehicles) and that categorize the vehicles into miner nodes and ordinary nodes (Revocation Authority). Both parties exchange information with each other and the blockchain network of the controller nodes. These nodes form the blockchain overlay at the top as they hold the information of the vehicle network and share it in a distributed manner with other controller nodes. Each communication is made public using  public private key encrpytion.
The next layer of the blockchain overlay is made by the miner nodes. Miner nodes are chosen vehicles, that have three asset classifications: Computing, Sensors and Data Storage. The interplay between the three tasks is as follows: The data storage stores the substance of the vehicle created by applications and sensors of the vehicle itself, in addition with other data such as visual data and multimedia. The network supports the sharing of information between members of the blockchain network by accepting an external pursuit request.

Various scenarios are supported by such a network. Examples are payment and the sharing of vehicles.

The approach presented by \citeauthor{Sharma2017} is the only approach so far, that thinks far beyond the incorporation of the blockchain into autonomous vehicles: It presents a framework for the controlled and secured interaction between all kinds of IoT devices. Cars as a special case are just one of them. The approach is very generally described and the exact mechanisms that include the blockchain are not yet beyond an explanatory stage.
The idea though of having multiple layers of nodes that all incorporate the blockchain, but have different rights to access it, seems very promising and suits well to the hierarchical strucuture that are necessary to organize a smart city network. In some way it can be thought of a system of checks and balances where some nodes have more rights, but their actions can always be seen from everywhere at any time.
Again though, even though the Blockchain is presented as central agent o this system and as the solution to the future of IoT networks, it remains one amongst many other parts of the overall system. Various central authorities remain necessary if the digital has to be linked with the real world.

The idea to run an smart city IoT network on the blockchain is an obvious one. But by looking at the things the blockchain actually solves, we see that it does not solve any problems that wouldnt be there with a traditional client-server architecture. The presented architecture does not need the Blockchain. The only advantage the blockchain offers is its tamperproofness, its transparency and distributional powers. But none of that is a necessary component of such an IoT network. And in the end we end up with a private permissioned blockchain that is striped off its real blockchain-powers in order to be controllable and easy to use. Therefore it is nothing else than another form of database, that could be replaced with any other database architecture.

\subsubsection{Personal Data Protection and Sharing in the medical sector}
No specific field is that much torn between data sharing and data protection like the medical sector. One one hand, sharing private data is necessary so ensure safe medication and even save lifes, on the other hand the data is extremely sensitive and can inflict big problems on individuals if made public. 
On the problematic of sharing and protecting electroninc healthcare records we are going to elaborate the quality the blockchain offers and discuss whether its use is really necessary or not.

\cite{Kshetri2017}: 
To ensure the security and privacy of identity and other personal data three parties are involved in a typical identity document exchannge:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item subject of identity, which can be an individual or an asset
	\item A certifier, which is often a government agency, a firm, which notarizes the documents
	\item Inquisitor that makes an inquiry on the subject in order to investigate requirements or a similar cause 
\end{enumerate}
Meanwhile in the health-care sector three traditional models exist to deal with the facility of interoperability of medical data:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Push model: Medical information is sent from one provider to another
	\item Pull model: A provider asks another provider for information
	\item View model: A provider looks at another providers record.
\end{itemize}
A major drawback to all of these models is that the data is not audited or tracked in a standardized way. For example, if a patient is transferred to a different hospital, the new hospital may not be able to access data that was not "pushed". This lack of audit trail means that there is no guarantee of data integrity from the point where data is generated to the point where it is used. 
It is argued by \cite{Kshetri2017} that the blockchain offers a fourth model, which makes it possible to share medical records securely accross providers during the lifetime of a patient without having the need to include a trusted third party into the process.
This approach allow intelligent record access by the owner of the data himself and to create an audit trail at the same time.

Especially powerful is the combination of IoT and the Blockchain in the healthcare sector. For instance can smart IoT devices carry out autonomous transactions through smart contracts on the Blockchain, which guarantees access control and tamperproofness at the same time. \citeauthor{Kshetri2017 -- > Quelle} even claim that through Blockchain military-grade security can be reached by e.g. storing cryptographic hashes of individual data and device firmware in a private Blockchain. Such a system can create permanent record of device content and state, that can be used to verify the datas integrity as well as the devices full functionality and whether the software has been altered.

Based on these thoughts various products and concepts have been created to make use of these properties of the Blockchain to control access to personal data, while at the same time make it accessible at all times through third parties if needed. 

MedRec by \citeauthor{Azaria2016}:
The MedRec system is a sophisticated network to share and protect clinical data using the blockchain and smart contracts. Via smart contracts on an Ethereum blockchain they log patient-provider relationships that associate a medical record with viewing permissions and data retrieval instructions of execution on external databases.
Providers can add new records associated with a particular patient and patients can atuhorize sharing of records between providers. The involved parties are notified by automated notifications when changes occur or new data is added.
By carrying out different kinds of policies, designed to implement any kind of rules, are carried out by the particular smart contracts to enforce data alteration only by legitimate transactions.
To make the potentially large amount of record representations possible the system provides three different types of smart contracts: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Registrar Contracts, that map participant identification strings to their Ethereum address identiy, such that the registration of new identities can be restricted to certified institutions.
	\item Patient-PRovider Relationship Contracts: Issued when one node stores and manages medical records of the other.
	\item Summary Contracts, that function as bread crumb trail for participants in the system to locate their medical record history
\end{itemize}

The system consists on system nodes that are run by providers, that require a full server and database infrastructure, and patient nodes that can be run on any mobile device or via a web-interface, using only a local database with the patients own data.
MedRec offers two kinds of incentives to run a system node:
The first one is based on Ethereums own inherent incentivizing model. Miners who managa to solve the crypto-puzzle and to incorporate a block into the chain get an amount of Ether on their account, that allows them to pay for transactions.
The second one is targeting researchers, that get rewarded by getting access to anonymized health data.

An uncovered topic in the whole medical sector that is never mentioned by any of the papers is the right to forget, as granted by e.g. the GDPR. This fundamental right of a person/patient to make records disappear is a big problem once a record is in the blockchain. Of course really letting a medical record disappear in traditional systems might be considered impossible as well, but at least from a theoretical point of view, a traditional system allows the deletion of a record. Meanwhile a blockchain based system, does per design not make it possible to delete anything at all, as it is stored within the chain, in an unmodifiable way.

\citeauthor{Cao2019} propose a different model for dealing with patient data:
Existing cloud solutions for medical records as appealing as they are, have many critical privacy and security concerns, as the records in no case should be leaked. However existing cloud service providers would not accept liability for privacy protection against adversaries and only protect the privacy as much as possible. Additionally, the real location of the records is unclear when using cloud based systems 
\citeauthor{Cao2019} analyze multiple existing cloud-assisted eHealth systems and point out, that existing schemes cannot ensure the correctness and integrity of oursourced medical records. Especially not in the case, when a authorized doctor colludes with the cloud server to modify outsourced records which are generated by him himself.

To answer these problems \citeauthor{Cao2019} propose a secure cloud-based system, that ensures the confidentiality, correctness and integriy of oursourced medical records without introducing any trusted third party. In that system records generated by one doctor during a treatment period, are integrated into a transaction of blockchain-based currencies. Meanwhile the system employs a user-friendly password-based key agreement to establish secure channels between patients and doctors.

The proposed system works in the following way: Each patient makes an appointment with the hospital and obtains a treatment key for diagnosis. With the treatment key, a secure channel between patient and hospital and the doctors is established. 
Before the treatment time, the patient generates warrants to delegate to doctors, that indicate the identities of the treating doctors for a specific treatment time and other auxiliary information.
During the treatment time, doctors generate medical records for the patient: In the single-doctor use-case, these are generated by just one doctor, in the multi-doctor use-case, medical records are successively generated by all treating doctors based on the record by the previous doctor. In the latter case each doctor is not only responsible for his own data, but also for the records his predecessors have generated.
The security of this system relies on the security of the Ethereum blockchain and the secure session established based on the treatment key. It mainly ensures that no malicious doctor can modify any record in an unauthorized or misusing way, due to the timeliness and tamperproofness of the Blockchain.

The system is claimed to be secure against:
\begin{itemize}
	\item medical record modification attacks
	\item imporsonation attacks
	\item change of timeline
\end{itemize}
All mechanisms that ensure the systems security are based on the blockchain. The system therefore is very much dependent on the blockchains mechanisms.

Even though this approach is far less extensive than the MedRec approach it does ensure the secure dealing of medical records through patients and doctors and provides to mechanisms to prevent any forging or tampering with the data through authenticated or unauthenticated people.
The only critical point, that challenges the use of the blockchain is again the question "Are all writers trusted?"\cite{Wust2017}. And again we face the problem, that it is the transitioning part of the whole process, the moment when the real world gets projected by a human being onto the digital world, that imposes the vulnerability.
If we do not trust the doctors to create rightful medical records, why do we consult them? And if we do trust them, why do we need a mechanism that prevents the doctors from forging medical records?
OF course one might argue, that there is always good and bad doctors, and that such a system provides a good control against elements in e.g. a chain of treating doctors. But from a theoretical point of view, the question remains. And leads to the conclusion, that in the end, we cannot outsource trust to a machine. 
Disregarding of this general problem, the system does provide good security mechanisms against impersonation attacks and forgery that are undoubtely useful and an improvement that is produced by the nature of the blockchain itself.
The question whether such a system must be run on the blockchain can therefore not be answered finally. The Blockchain is used to make the system more secure, Yes, but the blockchain cannot take over the responsibility for human or institutional malevolence.


A slightly different focus is taken by \citeauthor{Baccarini2018}. This paper tackles the problem of IoT medical sensors, that store and transfer data. They propose a private Blockchain based on the Ethereum Blockchain, where smart devices can call smart contracts and write records into the Blockchain.
The whole field of IoT devices also spreads into the direction of so called Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). In a WBAN a patient is equipped with one or multiple wearable or implanted medical devices that take real-time measurements of vital indicators, such as heart rate or glucose levels. All devices report to one master device that collects and aggregates the data and offers a user friendly interface. 
It is obvious why especially in this field multiple security concerns arise: Live patient data is a lucrative target for hackers and poses not only a threat to the patients health itself, but also to the privacy of its data.
To address these concerns \citeauthor{Baccarini2018} propose integrating WBAN systems with smart contracts on a consortium-managed blockchain in order to provide a distributed data processing service, that creates an immutable log of the transactions between WBAN devices and the health care providers. This system allows for automatic notifications of health events to medical professionals in real time in a secure manner. 
The proposed system works as follows:  
A patient wears one or multiple health monitor devices prescribed an applied by a doctor. The raw data of all devices gets collected and aggregated on a smart phone or a tablet and is then, together with customized threshold variables, sent to a specific smart contract on the blockchain. The smart contract evaluates the data and issues alerts to both patient and healthcare provider, as well as automated treatment instructions to the actuator nodes, if necessary.
In that way no medical information is stored on the blockchain or in the smart contract. The only record that gets stored is that what kinds of  events occured. The data itself is forwarded to a designated storage database. Meanwhile a new transaction is stored in the blockchain, saying that the data was successfully processed. In the same way, all treatment commands from the smart contract and healthcare provider will be recorded as complete in the blockchain.
To authenticate the data later and to prevent and detect alterations, whether on purpose or accident, the blockchain transactions can be linked to the storage base where the patients medical history lies.
The system is based on a private and consortium-led blockchain,which allows only designated members to read the blocks, execure smart contracts or verify new blocks.
Nodes in this system are different healthcare companies, that are predefined, such that no rogue members can sneak in.
Additionally, due to the systems modular and customizable smart contracts, it is very easy to replace or upgrade old contracts or incoporate new ones.

Compared with traditional systems, the blockchain based system offers higher performance regarding the availability, the immutability, privacy and transparency of the data. All due to the blockchains design. Regarding confidentiality and speed, the proposed system performs worse or equal than traditional systems.
The largest challenge of the system is maintaing security at every individual node. Because the traffic of the master device of the WBAN is routet via the users internet connection, the data is possibly transmissioned over an open channel.  Other challenges are key management on a large scale and the block verification times, when the alert issued by the smart contract takes too long.

This system is fundamentally different from the others in one aspect: The initially generated data is generated by an IoT device and is per se, digital. No translation step happens between the generation and the incorporation of the data.
The use of the blockchain as underlying system therefore makes a lot of sense, as it does not just use the blockchain architecture as a replacement for any kind of database, but - especially in the combination with the smart contract - to a real entity that supports the interconnection of IoT devices with the service provider in a distributed, secure and tamperproof manner. The fact that it does not use the blockchain to actually store data, but only to log the transitions emphasized this aspect.
In our opinion, the system by  \citeauthor{Baccarini2018} is the only approach that has real use for the design of the blockchain, without trying to alter its nature. Also according to \citeauthor{Wust2017} the permissioned private blockchain is the right choice, to create maximum privacy, while at the same time distributing the data securly to the right place at the right time.
The still exsiting security flaws (see above) do not have anything to do with the system as such and are a problematic aspect in almost any other approach as well. They could be fixed with no real change to the systems architecture. 

\subsubsection{Concluding remarks}

The covered topics show a broad use of the blockchain in order to increase a systems security. Most of the time the blockchain is chosen as a way to store data in a tamperproof manner and to be able to verify the integrity of the data. 
Most approaches however, be it for reasons of following the trend or other reasons, do not take the blockchain for what it is, and instead try to create a suitable database system that suits their use-case best. Reducing it to a distributed, tamper-proof database. The result is always a private permissioned blockchain, that has no real solution for the intial problem: The incorporation of the data iselft into the blockchain. The human as first actor and the problems that arise with this fact are neglected.
Promising are use-cases where such a human- or translation-factor does not exist per se. Use-cases that already have that kind of data at hand that suits a blockchain scenario. Such approaches can exploit the advantages and properties of the blockchain technology at its fullest, without twisting it to fit a specific purpose.
Therefore, if the blockchain is able to act as its own entity, that in an "intelligent" way - through the use of e.g. smart contracts - is allowed to do what it can best, namely act on its own, distributing data in a secure and tamperproof way and secure it forever, the approach has a huge potential.
