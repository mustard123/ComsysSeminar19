  abstract = {Future smart vehicles will be part of the Internet of Things to offer beneficial development opportunities for both end users as well as the automotive industry. This will potentially expose smart vehicles to a range of security and privacy threats such as tracking or hijacking a vehicle while driving. A comprehensive security architecture for automotive systems is required to allow the development of new services while protecting the vehicles from attacks and ensuring the privacy of the end users. In this paper we argue that BlockChain (BC), a disruptive technology that has found many applications from cryptocurrency to smart contracts, is a potential solution to automotive security and privacy challenges. We propose a BC-based architecture to protect the privacy of the users and to increase the security of the vehicular eco-system. Wireless remote software updates and other emerging services in the automotive world such as dynamic vehicle insurance fees, are used to illustrate the utilization of the proposed security architecture. We also provide discussions on the security of the architecture against important attacks.},

  abstract = {Today's storage systems expose abstractions which are either too low-level (e.g., key-value store, raw-block store) that they require developers to re-invent the wheels, or too high-level (e.g., relational databases, Git) that they lack generality to support many classes of applications. In this work, we propose and implement a general distributed data storage system, called UStore, which has rich semantics. UStore delivers three key properties, namely immutability, sharing and security, which unify and add values to many classes of today's applications, and which also open the door for new applications. By keeping the core properties within the storage, UStore helps reduce application development efforts while offering high performance at hand. The storage embraces current hardware trends as key enablers. It is built around a data-structure similar to that of Git, a popular source code versioning system, but it also synthesizes many designs from distributed systems and databases. Our current implementation of UStore has better performance than general in-memory key-value storage systems, especially for version scan operations. We port and evaluate four applications on top of UStore: a Git-like application, a collaborative data science application, a transaction management application, and a blockchain application. We demonstrate that UStore enables faster development and the UStore-backed applications can have better performance than the existing implementations.},

However, most of these IoT devices are easy to hack and compromise. Typically, these IoT devices are limited in compute, storage, and network capacity, and therefore they are more vulnerable to attacks than other endpoint devices such as smartphones, tablets, or computers. In this paper, we present and survey major security issues for IoT. We review and categorize popular security issues with regard to the IoT layered architecture, in addition to protocols used for networking, communication, and management. We outline security requirements for IoT along with the existing attacks, threats, and state-of-the-art solutions. Furthermore, we tabulate and map IoT security problems against existing solutions found in the literature. More importantly, we discuss, how blockchain, which is the underlying technology for bitcoin, can be a key enabler to solve many IoT security problems. The paper also identifies open research problems and challenges for IoT security.},

Blockchain technology offers an out-of-the-box solution that not only reduces the complexity of signaling DDoS attack information, but could also provide means of establishing financial incentives, for cooperation at a reduced operational cost. This work presents the Blockchain Signaling System (BloSS), a novel approach deploying hardware to simplify the signaling of DDoS attacks in a cooperative network defense system.},

abstract = {Denial of service (DoS) attacks continue to threaten the reliability of networking systems. Previous approaches for protecting networks from DoS attacks are reactive in that they wait for an attack to be launched before taking appropriate measures to protect the network. This leaves the door open for other attacks that use more sophisticated methods to mask their traffic.We propose an architecture called Secure Overlay Services (SOS) that proactively prevents DoS attacks, geared toward supporting Emergency Services or similar types of communication. The architecture is constructed using a combination of secure overlay tunneling, routing via consistent hashing, and filtering. We reduce the probability of successful attacks by (i) performing intensive filtering near protected network edges, pushing the attack point perimeter into the core of the network, where high-speed routers can handle the volume of attack traffic, and (ii) introducing randomness and anonymity into the architecture, making it difficult for an attacker to target nodes along the path to a specific SOS-protected destination.Using simple analytical models, we evaluate the likelihood that an attacker can successfully launch a DoS attack against an SOS-protected network. Our analysis demonstrates that such an architecture reduces the likelihood of a successful attack to minuscule levels.},

The finds comprise the cranial and some post-cranial remains of one individual, as well as a premolar from another individual in older deposits. Here we describe their context, implications and the remaining archaeological uncertainties. Dating by radiocarbon (14C), lumi- nescence, uranium-series and electron spin resonance (ESR) methods indicates that H. floresiensis existed from before 38,000 years ago (kyr) until at least 18 kyr. Associated deposits contain stone artefacts and animal remains, including Komodo dragon and an endemic, dwarfed species of Stegodon. H. floresiensis originated from an early dispersal of Homo erectus (including specimens referred to as Homo ergaster and Homo georgicus)1 that reached Flores, and then survived on this island refuge until relatively recently. It overlapped significantly in time with Homo sapiens in the region2,3 , but we do not know if or how the two species interacted.},

Each member of the network has access to the latest copy of encrypted ledger so that they can validate a new transaction. Blockchain ledger is a collection of all Bitcoin transactions executed in the past. Basically, it's a distributed database which maintains a continuously growing tamper proof data structure blocks which holds batches of individual transactions. The completed blocks are added in a linear and chronological order. Each block contains a timestamp and information link which points to a previous block. Bitcoin is peer-to-peer permission-less network which allows every user to connect to the network and send new transaction to verify and create new blocks. Satoshi Nakamoto described design of Bitcoin digital currency in his research paper posted to cryptography listserv in 2008. Nakamoto's suggestion has solved long pending problem of cryptographers and laid the foundation stone for digital currency. This paper explains the concept, characteristics, need of Blockchain and how Bitcoin works. It attempts to highlights role of Blockchain in shaping the future of banking, financial institutions and adoption of Internet of Things(IoT).},

abstract = {Autonomous and self-driving vehicles are appearing on the public highways. These vehicles commonly use wireless communication techniques for both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Manufacturers, regulators and the public are understandably concerned about large-scale systems failure or malicious attack via these wireless vehicular networks. This paper explores the use of sensing and signalling devices that are commonly integrated into modern vehicles for side-channel communication purposes. Visible light (using a CMOS camera) and acoustic (ultrasonic audio) side-channel encoding techniques are proposed, developed and evaluated in this context. The side-channels are examined both theoretically and experimentally and an upper bound on the line code modulation rate that is achievable with these side channel schemes in the vehicular networking context is established. A novel inter-vehicle session key establishment protocol, leveraging both side-channels and a blockchain public key infrastructure, is then presented. In light of the limited channel capacity and the interoperability/security requirements for vehicular communications, techniques for constraining the throughput requirement, providing device independence and validating the location of the intended recipient vehicle, are presented. These reduce the necessary device handshake throughput to 176 bits for creating symmetric encryption and message authentication keys and in verifying a vehicle's certificate with a recognised certification authority.},

We make a number of observations, including the lack of publicly available IoT datasets that can be used by the research and practitioner communities. Given the potentially sensitive nature of IoT datasets, there is a need to develop a standard for sharing IoT datasets among the research and practitioner communities and other relevant stakeholders. Thus, we posit the potential for blockchain technology in facilitating secure sharing of IoT datasets (e.g., using blockchain to ensure the integrity of shared datasets) and securing IoT systems, before presenting two conceptual blockchain-based approaches. We then conclude this paper with nine potential research questions.},

  abstract = {A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records, or public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction in the public ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system. Once entered, information can never be erased. The blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record of every single transaction ever made. Bitcoin, the decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency, is the most popular example that uses blockchain technology. The digital currency bitcoin itself is highly controversial but the underlying blockchain technology has worked flawlessly and found wide range of applications in both financial and non-financial world. The main hypothesis is that the blockchain establishes a system of creating a distributed consensus in the digital online world. This allows participating entities to know for certain that a digital event happened by creating an irrefutable record in a public ledger. It opens the door for developing a democratic open and scalable digital economy from a centralized one. There are tremendous opportunities in this disruptive technology, and the revolution in this space has just begun. This white paper describes blockchain technology and some compelling specific applications in both financial and non-financial sector. We then look at the challenges ahead and business opportunities in this fundamental technology that is all set to revolutionize our digital world.},

Bitcoin has demonstrated in the financial space that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a blockchain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party. Unlike Bitcoin, transactions in our system are not strictly financial – they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to blockchains that could harness them into a well-rounded solution for trusted computing problems in society.},

However, as with many fashionable jargon, there seems to be very little understanding of what the term really entails. Although this is may not be an issue when the term is used in an informal context, it can potentially cause considerable problems in context of organizational strategy, business objectives, or international agreements. In this work, we study the existing literature to identify the main definitions provided for the term ‘Cyber Security' by authoritative sources. We then conduct various lexical and semantic analysis techniques in an attempt to better understand the scope and context of these definitions, along with their relevance. Finally, based on the analysis conducted, we propose a new improved definition that we then demonstrate to be a more representative definition using the same lexical and semantic analysis techniques.},

Sharing of healthcare data is one essential step to make healthcare system smarter and improve the quality of healthcare service. Healthcare data, one personal asset of patient, should be owned and controlled by patient, instead of being scattered in different healthcare systems, which prevents data sharing and puts patient privacy at risks. Blockchain is demonstrated in the financial field that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we proposed an App (called Healthcare Data Gateway (HGD)) architecture based on blockchain to enable patient to own, control and share their own data easily and securely without violating privacy, which provides a new potential way to improve the intelligence of healthcare systems while keeping patient data private. Our proposed purpose-centric access model ensures patient own and control their healthcare data; simple unified Indicator-Centric Schema (ICS) makes it possible to organize all kinds of personal healthcare data practically and easily. We also point out that MPC (Secure Multi-Party Computing) is one promising solution to enable untrusted third-party to conduct computation over patient data without violating privacy.},

In order to handle the protected health information (PHI) generated by these devices, we propose utilizing blockchain-based smart contracts to facilitate secure analysis and management of medical sensors. Using a private blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol, we created a system where the sensors communicate with a smart device that calls smart contracts and writes records of all events on the blockchain. This smart contract system would support real-time patient monitoring and medical interventions by sending notifications to patients and medical professionals, while also maintaining a secure record of who has initiated these activities. This would resolve many security vulnerabilities associated with remote patient monitoring and automate the delivery of notifications to all involved parties in a HIPAA compliant manner.Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

However, that leads to data deletion becomes a security challenge because the cloud server may not delete the data honestly for financial incentives. Recently, plenty of research works have been done on secure data deletion. However, most of the existing methods can be summarized with the same protocol essentially, which called “one-bit-return” protocol: the storage server deletes the data and returns a one-bit result. The data owner has to believe the returned result because he cannot verify it. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based data deletion scheme, which can make the deletion operation more transparent. In our scheme, the data owner can verify the deletion result no matter how malevolently the cloud server behaves. Besides, with the application of blockchain, the proposed scheme can achieve public verification without any trusted third party.},

Given the magnitude of securing cyberspace, a reflection on what we are trying to do seems in order. Several questions arise, such as what exactly the infrastructure is, what threats it must be secured against, and how protection can be provided on a cost-effective basis. But underlying all these questions is how to define a secure system. What is security? Having it is obviously good; everyone says so. But few people define it exactly, or even nebulously.

Moreover, the paper posits that cyber security goes beyond the boundaries of traditional information security to include not only the protection of information resources, but also that of other assets, including the person him/herself. In information security, reference to the human factor usually relates to the role(s) of humans in the security process. In cyber security this factor has an additional dimension, namely, the humans as potential targets of cyber attacks or even unknowingly participating in a cyber attack. This additional dimension has ethical implications for society as a whole, since the protection of certain vulnerable groups, for example children, could be seen as a societal responsibility. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We conducted laboratory choice trials in which ant colonies chose between Cordia alliodora seedlings with high (E(high)) or low (E(low)) densities of endophytes. The E(high) seedlings contained 5.5 times higher endophyte content and a greater diversity of fungal morphospecies than the E(low) treatment, and endophyte content was not correlated with leaf toughness or thickness. Leaf-cutting ants cut over 2.5 times the leaf area from E(low) relative to E(high) seedlings and had a tendency to recruit more ants to E(low) plants. Our findings suggest that leaf-cutting ants may incur costs from cutting and processing leaves with high endophyte loads, which could impact Neotropical forests by causing variable damage rates within plant communities.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the design and development of a decentralized firewall system powered by a novel malware detection engine. The firewall is built using blockchain technology. The detection engine aims to classify Portable Executable (PE) files as malicious or benign. File classification is carried out using a deep belief neural network (DBN) as the detection engine. Our approach is to model the files as grayscale images and use the DBN to classify those images into the aforementioned two classes. An extensive data set of 10,000 files is used to train the DBN. Validation is carried out using 4,000 files previously unexposed to the network. The final result of whether to allow or block a file is obtained by arriving at a proof of work based consensus in the blockchain network.},

  abstract = {With the purpose of identifying cyber threats and possible incidents, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are widely deployed in various computer networks. In order to enhance the detection capability of a single IDS, collaborative intrusion detection networks (or collaborative IDSs) have been developed, which allow IDS nodes to exchange data with each other. However, data and trust management still remain two challenges for current detection architectures, which may degrade the effectiveness of such detection systems. In recent years, blockchain technology has shown its adaptability in many fields, such as supply chain management, international payment, interbanking, and so on. As blockchain can protect the integrity of data storage and ensure process transparency, it has a potential to be applied to intrusion detection domain. Motivated by this, this paper provides a review regarding the intersection of IDSs and blockchains. In particular, we introduce the background of intrusion detection and blockchain, discuss the applicability of blockchain to intrusion detection, and identify open challenges in this direction. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

This rep-utation is in particular attributable to its properties of allowing mutually mistrusting entities to exchange financial value and interact without rely-ing on a trusted third party. A blockchain moreover provides an integrity protected data storage and allows to provide process transparency. In this article we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we an-alyze in depth three use cases — Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organiza-tions and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.},

@article{Li2018,
  abstract = {With the development of Internet technology, the volume of data is increasing tremendously. To tackle with large-scale data, more and more applications choose to enlarge the storage capacity of users' terminals with the help of cloud platforms. Before storing data to an untrusted cloud server, some measures should be adopted to guarantee the data security. However, the communication overhead will increase dramatically when users transmit files encrypted by a traditional encryption scheme. In this paper, we address the above problems by proposing a blockchain-based security architecture for distributed cloud storage, where users can divide their own files into encrypted data chunks, and upload those data chunks randomly into the P2P network nodes that provide free storage capacity. We customize a genetic algorithm to solve the file block replica placement problem between multiple users and multiple data centers in the distributed cloud storage environment. Numerical results show that the proposed architecture outperforms the traditional cloud storage architectures in terms of file security and network transmission delay. On average, the file loss rate based on the simulation assumptions utilized in this paper is close to 0{\%} on our architecture while it's nearly 100{\%} and 71.66{\%} on the architecture with single data center and the distributed architecture using genetic algorithm. Besides, with proposed scheme, the transmission delay on the proposed architecture is reduced by 39.28{\%} and 76.47{\%} on average on the user's number and the number of file block replicas, respectively, in comparison to the architecture with single data center. Meanwhile, the transmission delay of file block replicas is also reduced by 41.36{\%} on average than that on the distributed architecture using genetic algorithm.},

We now face a critical need for such innovation, as personalization and data science prompt patients to engage in the details of their healthcare and restore agency over their medical data. In this paper, we propose MedRec: a novel, decentralized record management system to handle EMRs, using blockchain technology. Our system gives patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across providers and treatment sites. Leveraging unique blockchain properties, MedRec manages authentication, confidentiality, accountability and data sharing - crucial considerations when handling sensitive information. A modular design integrates with providers' existing, local data storage solutions, facilitating interoperability and making our system convenient and adaptable. We incentivize medical stakeholders (researchers, public health authorities, etc.) to participate in the network as blockchain "miners". This provides them with access to aggregate, anonymized data as mining rewards, in return for sustaining and securing the network via Proof of Work. MedRec thus enables the emergence of data economics, supplying big data to empower researchers while engaging patients and providers in the choice to release metadata. The purpose of this short paper is to expose, prior to field tests, a working prototype through which we analyze and discuss our approach.},

The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

D3NS eliminates the need for certificate authorities by providing a decentralized authenticated record of domain name ownership. Unlike previous DNS replacement proposals, D3NS is reverse compatible with DNS and allows for incremental implementation within the current system.},

abstract  = {This paper evaluates blockchain's roles in strengthening cybersecurity and protecting privacy. Since most of the data is currently stored in cloud data centers, it also compares how blockchain performs vis-vis the cloud in various aspects of security and privacy. Key underlying mechanisms related to the blockchain's impacts on the Internet of Things (IoT) security are also covered. From the security and privacy considerations, it highlights how blockchain-based solutions could possibly be, in many aspects, superior to the current IoT ecosystem, which mainly relies on centralized cloud servers through service providers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the paper argues that blockchain's decentralized feature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is also given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The paper provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. The paper also delves into how blockchain can make it possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. It discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, inter-organizational networks and industries on this front. A number of policy implications are discussed. First, in order to strengthen IoT, regulators can make it obligatory for firms to deploy blockchain in supply chain, especially in systems that are mission critical, and have substantial national security and economic benefits. Second, public policy efforts directed at protecting privacy using blockchain should focus on providing training to key stakeholders and increasing investment in this technology. Third, one way to enrich the blockchain ecosystem would be to turn attention to public–private partnerships. Finally, national governments should provide legal clarity and more information for parties to engage in smart contracts that are enforceable.},

abstract = {A Keyless Signing Infrastructure (KSI) provides users with a means to timestamp documents on a per-second basis. The KSI consists of a global infrastructure with several server layers and by using Merkle hash trees, the root hash can be used to verify the integrity and timestamp of a document. Regular publication of root hashes, e.g., once per month, allows a document to be veriﬁed without support of the servers, but the previously proposed publication channels have several limitations. In this paper we address these limitations and show how a blockchain can be used as an additional publication layer on top of a KSI. Using the scripting capabilities in transactions, new features are introduced to the publication of root hashes. This includes faster publication, proof of origin for the publisher and the possibility for third parties to explicitly verify root hashes before they are published. These improvements will allow the veriﬁcation of documents to be simpler, more ﬂexible and more secure.},

abstract = {Traditional X.509 public key infrastructures (PKIs) depend on certiﬁcation authorities (CAs) to sign certiﬁcates, used in SSL/TLS to authenticate web servers and establish secure channels. However, recent security incidents indicate that CAs may (be compromised to) sign fraudulent certiﬁcates. In this paper, we propose blockchain-based certiﬁcate transparency and revocation transparency. Our scheme is compatible with X.509 PKIs but signiﬁcantly reinforces the security guarantees of a certiﬁcate. The CA-signed certiﬁcates and their revocation status information of an SSL/TLS web server are published by the subject (i.e., the web server) as a transaction, and miners of the community append it to the global certiﬁcate blockchain after verifying the transaction and mining a block. The certiﬁcate blockchain acts as append-only public logs to monitor CAs’ certiﬁcate signing and revocation operations, and an SSL/TLS web server is granted with the cooperative control on its certiﬁcates to balance the absolute authority of CAs in traditional PKIs. We implement the prototype system with Firefox and Nginx, and the experimental results show that it introduces reasonable overheads.},

These projects vary in scope from fullﬂedged domain name systems accompanied by a PKI to simpler transparency systems that augment the current HTTPS PKI. In this paper, we start by articulating, in a way we have not seen before, why this approach is more than a complementary composition of technologies, but actually a new and useful paradigm for thinking about who is actually authoritative over PKI information in the web certiﬁcate model. We then consider what smart contracts could add to the web certiﬁcate model, if we move beyond using a blockchain as passive, immutable (subject to consensus) store of data — as is the approach taken by projects like Blockstack. To illustrate the potential, we develop and experiment with an Ethereum-based web certiﬁcate model we call Ghazal, discuss diﬀerent design decisions, and analyze deployment costs.},

Users can register human meaningful names and securely associate data with them, and only the owner of the particular private keys that registered them can write or update the name-value pair. In theory, many decentralized systems can be built using these blockchain networks, such as new, decentralized versions of DNS and PKI. As the technology is relatively new and evolving rapidly, however, little production data or experience is available to guide design tradeoffs.},
