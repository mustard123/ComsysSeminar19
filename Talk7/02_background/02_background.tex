\section{Background}
\label{sec:02_background}

In this section, we try to build a solid foundation with regards to the theoretical concepts and background that are needed to follow the concepts presented in section \ref{sec:03_related_work}. We first present the traditional ideas as they have been part of research for the past decades (section \ref{subsec:02_cybersecurity}). Section \ref{subsec:02_blockchain} subsequently elaborates on the core concepts of the blockchain, as far as is needed to understand the main thesis of this work. Section \ref{subsec:02_smart_contracts} finally reviews the concept of smart contracts and how they developed as an evolution of the existing blockchain architecture.
