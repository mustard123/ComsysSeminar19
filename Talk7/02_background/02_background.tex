\section{Background}
\label{sec:02_background}

In this section, we build a foundation with regards to the theoretical concepts and background that are needed to follow the concepts presented in Section \ref{sec:03_related_work}. First Section \ref{subsec:02_cybersecurity} presents the traditional ideas of cybersecurity as they have been part of research for the past decades. Subsequently, Section \ref{subsec:02_Blockchain} elaborates on the core concepts of the Blockchain which are necessary to understand the main research topic of this work. Finally, Section \ref{subsec:02_smart_contracts} reviews the concept of smart contracts and how they have developed as an evolution of the existing Blockchain architecture.
